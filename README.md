Web-focused Software developer from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) with Frontend proficiency who enjoys participating in the entire solution of a problem.

I believe my greatest skills in development are attention to detail when coding a user interface, focus on delivering the simplest solution to the problem and always trying to improve the code to which I have to add a feature.
