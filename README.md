A web-focused Software developer from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) with Frontend proficiency who enjoys participating in the entire solution of a problem.

My most significant skills in development are attention to detail when coding a user interface, focusing on delivering the simplest solution to the problem, and always trying to improve the code to which I have to add a feature.
